## I built the backend for a blog website using framework and MySQL. Users can write blog posts, and add comments. Passwords are safely stored. I made different routes (APIs) to create, read, update, and delete blogs and comments. Each blog and comment is linked to the user who created it. I tested everything to make sure it works well. The backend is safe, easy to use, and ready to connect to any frontend website.
